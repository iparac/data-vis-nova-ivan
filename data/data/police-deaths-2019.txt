This file contains murders *of* police officers by county.

Names, locations, and means of the murder were copied from ODMP (link above).  The actual *county* was entered by hand.  When the county was ambiguous (e.g. the city was near a county border) the locations from ODMP was cross-referenced with https://www.randymajors.com/p/countygmap.html.

I removed accidents, friendly fire, unintentional vehicular deaths, cancer from 9/11, etc.
